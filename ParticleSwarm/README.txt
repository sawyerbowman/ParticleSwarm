DESCRIPTION:
This program implements particle swarm optimization with four different topologies and three different evaluation methods. 

HOW TO RUN:
The user must pass the following parameters as command line arguments.
Topology:	Which neighborhood topology to test ex. gl, ri, vn, ra (string)
Swarm Size:	The size of the swarm ex. 50 (int)
Iterations:	The number of iterations ex. 50000 (int)
Function:	Which function to optimize ex. rok, ack, ras (string)
Dimensions:	The dimensionality of the function ex 30 (int)
